# magento2-order-confirmation-email
Magento automatically sends various emails for registration, order, refunds and many more. Generally, Magento auto sends an email once the order is placed but what if someone wants to send email after a successful payment completion from the third-party payment gateways in Magento 2? one of our client came up with the same requirement of sending an order confirmation email after successful order payment.

Magento 2 provides the functionality of sending different store events like customer registration, order placement, refunds, etc. Once the order is placed it will automatically send an order confirmation email to your store customers without verifying payment response. Sometimes this process can be misleading cause normally store owner do not proceeds order until payment is not received to them. On the other side, your customer thinks that you have started working on their order but actually it's not.
